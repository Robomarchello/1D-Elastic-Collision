# 1D-Elastic-Collision

Elastic collision - is the collision where the kinetic energy is always the same

This is my implementation of it:)

Requirements:
Pygame

this made poorly, but my 2d elastic collision is much better👍

I have also made elastic collision in 2d for Pygame-community weekly challenges, Here it is:
